## Technical practices for developers working with open source projects in government
These guidance notes cover technical practices for developers working on government maintained open source software projects or when working with external open source projects with other developers as part of a wider open source community. It follows on from the NZGOAL Software Extension open source licensing policy for the New Zealand Government as during the public consultation on this policy it was raised as a need to help with the actual technical aspects of releasing open source licensed software.

It’s important to note that alongside the technical considerations in this guidance note, you should also familiarise yourself with the communication and community management aspects of open source which are available in a separate guidance note. Part of developing an open licensed project requires the ability to engage in dialogue about your work, code out on the open, give and receive feedback and interact with contributors in public while using modern software development practices to produce and maintain the project’s code base over time.
